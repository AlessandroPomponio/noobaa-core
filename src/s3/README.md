S3rver
==================

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/s3rver.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/s3rver/)

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jamhall/s3rver.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jamhall/s3rver)
 
S3rver is a NodeJs port of the excellent [Fake S3](https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3) server.

S3rver is a lightweight server that responds to the **some** of the same calls [Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html) responds to. It is extremely useful for testing S3 in a sandbox environment without actually making calls to Amazon.

The goal of S3rver is to minimise runtime dependencies and be more of a development tool to test S3 calls in your code rather than a production server looking to duplicate S3 functionality.

## Supported methods

### Buckets

- Create bucket
- Delete bucket
- List buckets
- List content of buckets (prefix, delimiter and max keys all work)

### Objects

- Put object
- Delete object
- Get object (including using the HEAD method)
- Get dummy ACLs for an object
- Copy object


## Quick Start

Install s3rver:
  
```bash
npm install s3rver -g
```
You will now have a command on your path called *s3rver*

Executing this command for the various options:

```bash
s3rver --help
```
## Caveats

Currently multipart uploads is not supported. It's fairly complex and cumbersome to implement, however, if there is strong support from the community for it, then it will be implemented, or if you would like to implement it yourself, please go ahead and send a pull request : ) 

## Supported clients

Please see [Fake S3s wiki page](https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3/wiki/Supported-Clients) for a list of supported clients.

Please test, if you encounter any problems please do not hesitate to open an issue :)

## Tests

> When running the tests with node v0.10.0 the following [error](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/777) is encountered. This is resolved by running the tests with v0.11.*. I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your node versions.
  
To run the test suite, first install the dependencies, then run `npm test`:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

## Programmatically running s3rver

You can also run s3rver programmatically. 

> This is particularly useful if you want to integrate s3rver into another projects tests that depends on access to an s3 environment

Example in mocha:
```
before(function (done) {
    var S3rver = require('s3rver');
    var s3rver = new S3rver();
    s3rver.setHostname('localhost')
      .setPort(4568)
      .setDirectory('/tmp/s3rver')
      .setSilent(false)
      .run(function (err, host, port) {
         if(err) {
           return done(err);
         }
         done();
      });
});
```
